# Changelog

## 2.0.0-rc.31

- Require centrally approved immutable GitHub Action commits before target
  branch qualification can pass.
- Keep dependency resolution compatible with the declared Rust 1.86 minimum.
- Align the crate README and generated API reference with the general-first
  install, local Server, API reference, and SDK-guide journey. Keep Cloud
  discoverable as a secondary limited early-access deployment path.
- Qualify the documentation hierarchy in source, generated rustdoc, and the
  packaged crate without binding the checks to Markdown prose or layout.

## 2.0.0-rc.30

- Remove the JSON payload-codecs feature and make the fixed typed Avro Value
  schema with single-object framing the only public payload codec.
- Reject JSON-tagged and unknown payload envelopes without transcoding or
  codec inference, qualified against Server `2.0.0-rc.32`.
- Replace exact prerelease pins and Cloud-first documentation with account-free
  Rust SDK onboarding through the public qualified versionless installer;
  Cloud remains available as a clearly labeled limited early-access path.

## 2.0.0-rc.12

- Add the initial task-oriented Rust documentation landing page and generated
  API reference navigation. The current general-first hierarchy is described
  in the `2.0.0-rc.31` entry.
- Let the released `hello_world` example accept separate client and worker
  credentials for one namespace-scoped Cloud runtime URL.
- Retain the qualified Server baseline at `2.0.0-rc.17` under the additive
  `>=2.0.0-rc.17,<2.0.0` compatibility range.

## 2.0.0-rc.11

- Reject unsupported update-validator declarations from the public low-level
  worker registration API before transport while preserving query and update
  handler contracts.
- Retain the qualified Server baseline at `2.0.0-rc.17` under the additive
  `>=2.0.0-rc.17,<2.0.0` compatibility range.

## 2.0.0-rc.10

- Declare the absence of an update-validator authoring surface in registered
  workflow contracts so Server discovery does not infer validator parity.
- Preserve the additive `>=2.0.0-rc.17,<2.0.0` protocol compatibility range.

## 2.0.0-rc.9

- Correct every shipped example to pass a Server origin or path-prefixed Cloud
  runtime URL without the SDK-owned `/api` suffix.
- Qualify the base-URL contract across all example sources and their rendered
  Rust documentation before publication.

## 2.0.0-rc.8

- Gracefully deregister successful worker registrations after all managed
  pollers have joined, while preserving both work-processing and cleanup errors.
- Add the typed worker-plane deregistration client operation and keep it
  separate from operator worker management.
- Enforce least-privilege token selection between worker, control, and shared
  credentials.
- Support Server `>=2.0.0-rc.17,<2.0.0` under the advertised protocol contract.
